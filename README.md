The BrightStar-Connect app and website will allow Bright Star Community Church to track event registration via an online process that will eliminate the paper-based process currently being used. 
 
Church Administration will easily be able to capture and track event registration. Church Members will easily be able to submit event registration via mobile devices (phone, tablets) and web.
